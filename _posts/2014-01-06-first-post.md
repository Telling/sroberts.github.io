## My First New Post
So after a lot of harassment by the likes of Ben Balter and some other GitHubber's I've decided it's a good time to learn Jekyll and GitHub Pages and start a blog.

I'm hoping to share:
* Some developing ideas
* Projects I've been working on
* Things I've been learning/trying to learn
* And responding in longer form to a few other folks on the Internet

So hit me up on Twitter (@sroberts) and let me know what you think.
