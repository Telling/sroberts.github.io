While not being much for New Years Resolutions (though I do love fireworks) last year I shared [some professional goals](http://sroberts.github.io/2015/01/06/2015-professional-goals/). I even advocated accountability. I figure I should share how I did.

## Professional Goals

| # | Goal | ? | Notes |
| - | ---- | - | ----- |
| 1 | Read one technical book a month | <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> | [I think I read about 6?](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9490230-scott-j) We had a fun little reading group that lasted until summer. |
| 2 | Blog at least once a week | <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> | I was doing well until June. I have an excuse, but I'll share that another time. |
| 3 | Learn a System Programming Language | <i class="fa fa-minus"></i> | Push? I spent a lot of time with [Go](https://golang.org/) and like it, but I never built anything. Not sure that counts. |

## Personal Goals

| # | Goal | ? | Notes |
| - | ---- | - | ----- |
| 1 | Read 12 Cooking Books | <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> | I didn't read 12. I read two ([1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811496-cooked) & [2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20721957-twelve-recipes)) but both were great. I cook a lot more and I'm happier for it.|
| 2 | Complete C25k | <i class="fa fa-minus"></i> | Push. I hate running. Still hate running. But [I got a bike and I love that](https://www.instagram.com/p/_rfgeazE8K/). Maybe more of a <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i>. |
| 3 | Get a dog | <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> | No push. His name is Kilo. He's a pain but [he's mine](https://www.instagram.com/p/61CHXCTE4o/), so [I love him](https://www.instagram.com/p/6EGxCZzE0B/). [He gets me.](https://www.instagram.com/p/6WHfgxzEz1/) |

## Overall

Not great. Not terrible... but not great. I accomplished a lot of what I was hoping for. I learned a ton, both expanding things I already knew and things I had no idea about. I'm healthier and I have a pretty awesome dog. Overall I'd count 2015 a win!

## 2016 Goals

I'm keeping it simpler, focusing on creating habits. These are things I want to do every day:

- __Chess:__ I'm not great at chess but I'd like to get better. Playing seems the best way.
- __Code:__ Pleasure or professional, either way. Since the first it's been a lot of hacking on [Brian Warehime](https://twitter.com/brian_warehime)'s excellent [Threat_Note](https://github.com/defpoint/threat_note).
- __Cook:__ Cooking has been good for me and I want to keep it up. [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/) has been helpful (not to mention tasty).
- __Exercise:__ Biking or walking the dog.
- __Read:__ Pleasure or professional, either way (again!).
- __Write:__ Blog or another project but the more I write the better.

These goals for 2016 are a lot more flexible. They're all things I do but not yet the habits I'd like them to be. I've been using the [Momentum](http://momentum.cc/) app to keep track and I find it's a great balance. In the 10 days since I started I've written and coded for 10 days in a row, played chess for 9, read and exercised for 3, and cooking has been the hardest with 2 days.

If you're interested in suggesting things to read, write, cook, code or want to play some chess let me know. Now I'm going to go check off my writing for today!
