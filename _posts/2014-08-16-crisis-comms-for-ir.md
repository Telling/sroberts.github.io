title: Crisis Communication for Incident Response
---

One of the parts of incident response that rarely gets a lot of attention in IR circles (though huge attention outside them) is a customer facing victim companies communication to their own customers.

## The 5 Keys to Incident Response Communication

### Be Clear
It's difficult to investigate many intrusions. It's often difficult to explain them, but it remains crucial that the communication about what happened be straight forward. Without this understanding victims will remain confused, and critics will remain skeptical.

### Be Timely
Ok, this one is tricky, likely the trickiest.
- If you communicate too early, before you full understand the intrusion, you have to make lots of follow-ups and seem out of control.
- If you communicate too late your warning is less actionable to victims and thus the impact is even worse.

### Be Actionable
Most people don't care about "XSRF whatever" and "Buffer Over blah blah blah". They want to know what this means to them: what information was exposed and what they need to do to fix it.

### Be Responsible
This is the bitter :pill:, and in todays overly litigious society one of the scariest portions, but also straight forward: Admiting you were wrong and saying you are sorry.

[TODO] ANECDOTE ABOUT DOCTORS SAYING THEY"RE SORRY

### Be Human
Ok, this one is personal, but one of the :key: things I have learned is you can't overvalue a sense of humanity in these communications. This is wildly difficult but crucially important. A feeling that a real person wrote something makes it easier to excuse things taking a bit longer than they could have, or makes the apology believable, instead of just lawyer speak. It's not easy, but it is worth it.
