title: FIRST 2015
---

I'm lucky enough to get to go to [FIRST 2015](http://www.first.org/conference/2015) in Berlin. I'll be speaking on Tuesday afternoon, but one of the best things about conferences like this is being able to attend other sessions. I've never been to FIRST before, and this year looks jam packed. Here are the talks I'm most excited about and you'll be likely to find me in.

## Monday June 15:

| Time | Talk | Author | My Thoughts |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| 11:00 | [Building instantly exploitable protection for yourself and your partners against targeted cyber threats using MISP](http://www.first.org/conference/2015/program#pbuilding-instantly-exploitable-protection-for-yourself-and-your-partners-against-targeted-cyber-threats-using-misp) | Mr. Andras IKLODY (CIRCL) | MISP is one of the bigger open source threat intelligence platforms (along with CRITs). I'm pretty familiar with CRITs, but I'm curious to see what mature MISP can do.|
| 13:00 | [3J4E - JIGSAW, JUMPSTART, JUNCTURE: Three Ways to Enhance Cyber-Exercise-Experience](http://www.first.org/conference/2015/program#p3j4e-jigsaw-jumpstart-juncture-three-ways-to-enhance-cyber-exercise-experience) | Mr. Stefan RITTER (National IT-Situation Centre and CERT-Bund, German Federal Office for Information Security BSI) | I'm really interested in writing better table top exercises. This seems like a dramatically different approach. |
| 14:00 | [So You Want a Threat Intelligence* Function (*But Were Afraid to Ask)](http://www.first.org/conference/2015/program#pso-you-want-a-threat-intelligence-function-but-were-afraid-to-ask) | Mr. Gavin REID (Lancope) | So this sounds along the lines of a talk that [Kyle Maxwell](http://xwell.org/) and I put together for [BlackHat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/) (but unfortunately didn't get accepted). I've thought a lot about how to build useful directed Threat Intelligence, so this is super curious. |
| 16:00 | [Incident Response Programming with R](http://www.first.org/conference/2015/program#pincident-response-programming-with-r) | Mr. Eric ZIELINSKI (Nationwide) | I don't write R, not sure I ever would, but better data analysis is super important for better incident response. Also Nationwide is from my current hometown, so I'm happy to support the local guy. |
