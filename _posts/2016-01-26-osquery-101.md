title: osquery 101 - Getting Started
---

I admit it... I'm a fanboy. Straight up [osquery](http://osquery.io) fanboy.

Oh... what is osquery you ask? Good question there sport.

> osquery allows you to easily ask questions about your Linux and OSX infrastructure. Whether your goal is intrusion detection, infrastructure reliability, or compliance, osquery gives you the ability to empower and inform a broad set of organizations within your company.

Or so says Facebook at least. For my money __osquery is the most effective way available to monitor an OSX or Linux host for security__. Not bad eh?

The big question everyone asks though is how do you get started with osquery, so without further ado:

## Install osquery

This one is pretty simple. Just follow these [handy instructions](https://osquery.io/downloads/).

__OSX Side Note:__ _If you're on OSX and a fan of Homebrew (as I am) you'll actually want to skip Homebrew this time and install the package directly. Homebrew gets weird about running things as root later on, and that'll be a pain. Safe yourself the pain._

## Using osqueryi

osquery provides two main interfaces to the user: osqueryi and osqueryd (we'll get to osqueryd in another post). osqueryi is a [REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) similar to `$ irb` or `$ python`. This lets you input a command and get back an immediate response. We can use this for a few things:

- One off, spot checking of specific system attributes.
- Developing new queries.
- Learning your way around osquery.

So lets give it a try. Get started simply by typing `osqueryi` at your terminal.

![osqueryi Prompt](/public/osqueryi-prompt.png)

# osquery... uh... queries

So now that you're at the prompt you're ready to start looking for things. osquery uses the [sqlite query language](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) for simplicity and descriptiveness. The most basic query format:

```
> SELECT columns FROM table;
```

> Don't forget the semicolon ";" at the end of your query!

For example lets take a look at the [OSX kernel extensions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html) I have installed:

![select from example](/public/osqueryi-selectfrom.png)

Ok, so that found the data I wanted, but honestly a bit too much. Every OSX system has Apple written extensions, which makes those less interesting. Using the sql concept of a _where_ clause we can limit this just to non-Apple kernel extensions:

![select from where example](/public/osqueryi-selectfromwhere.png)

Much more useful. Lets take it one step further and sort this to make it a bit more readable with a bit of sorting:

![select from where example](/public/osqueryi-selectfromwhereorderby.png)

For those playing at home you can see I have 11 kernel extensions for 5 applications (and OSX). The final query that got this information is:

```
> SELECT name FROM kernel_extensions WHERE name NOT LIKE 'com.apple%' ORDER BY name;
```

Pretty straight forward, but by now the power should be evident. As you practice more you can express some pretty powerful and complex ideas using this syntax. For more on syntax take a look at [the SELECT documentation for sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html). This coupled with the [osquery Tables reference](https://osquery.io/docs/tables/) will give you most of what you need. A few key, non SELECT, commands that will help you get started:

| Command | Use |
| ------- | --- |
| `.help` | Gives you the osqueryi help dialogue
| `.schema [TABLE]` | Prints the table columns and data types |
| `.exit` | It isn't `exit` or `quit` or `exit()` |

If you want some examples of what you can look for and how you can use the sqlite syntax take a look at the [osquery Packs](https://osquery.io/docs/packs/).

## Want to Learn More?

So do I. There's a lot to osquery. It's not a solution, it's a framework. On one hand that makes it customizable, on the other that many parts of using it are _left to the user_. It may be free, but that means it's an investment of time rather than money.

[Kevin Thompson](https://twitter.com/bfist) and I spoke about osqueryi and more at [BSidesDFW 2015](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/79986053/BSidesDFW):

I'll explore some of these ideas from our presentation in the next post in this series: __osquery 110 - Programmatic osqueryi__.
