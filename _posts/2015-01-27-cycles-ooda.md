title: Intelligence Concepts: OODA
---

The information security community loves lists, cycles, and other recipes for actions. Recipes are tough. In many cases (like in baking) they are rigorous: miss one step and the bread doesn't rise. In other cases they need to be flexible and open to change like making soup. It's only once you're making it that you can check everything and decide if you need a bit more of something. Incident response is a lot like a recipe. We have important steps that need to be followed, but no investigation is exactly the same, and everyone requires a bit of improvisation.

So how do you balance these needs? The paradox of disciplined steps mixed with room to adapt to a situation. Lots of groups are posing solutions, some useful, some not so useful, and some 100% misconstrued.

I'm going to take this week to break down a number of the most common cycles and processes including OODA (below), the Intelligence Cycle, the Cyber Kill Chain, & F3EAD.

## [The OODA Loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)
OODA is easily the most misunderstood cycle on this list. It is simple but powerful, so powerful it causes people to what to over think it. At it's core OODA is an abstraction of the typical human thought process. Developed by American fighter pilot and tactician [Col. John Boyd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)) to understand fighter engagements the OODA loop is applicable to most decision cycles, including incident response decisions.

While the annotated version above is complex at it's core the OODA Loop is made up of four simple steps.

- __Observe:__ Gathering data that may be relevant for action.
- __Orient:__ Next information is contextualized by the decision maker.
- __Decide:__ Finally based on the contextualized data a decision is made.
- __Act:__ The decided upon course of action is carried out.

At this point the cycle restarts based on observing the results of the action.

### Takeaways from OODA

The great thing about OODA is it gives us a framework to talk about how we make decisions. At it's core the thing Col Boyd was able to show in a concrete way something everyone implicitly understands: _whoever makes decisions and acts fastest has a distinct advantage_.

For incident response our goal needs to ultimately be to OODA faster than attackers. In most cases at it's core improving a DFIR capability is all about being able to OODA faster as a team. New sensors improve your ability to observe while threat intelligence data improves orientation. You can't really put OODA into practice, but it can be used to structure how you think about decision making, and what you can do to improve the speed with which you make decisions.
