title: A Basic Guide to Incident Response
---

I was lucky enough to be invited to speak at an education technical conference Tech Talk Live Cyber Security Symposium. I wanted to do something new, something different. I've long been an advocate of intelligence driven incident response, but had never seen a sufficiently useful presentation to introduce this complex but powerful work flow to others. So I tried to make one.

## Presentation
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="c7eaaeb0b769013184ad42b7f74d85e8" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Overall I was pleased with how the talk was recieved. Schools face a myriad of cyber threats from the mundane to the sophisticated, but lack resources in terms of money, people, and time. I  don't know if central PA schools are going to see booming intel driven IR programs, but I hope there were some interesting ideas for them.

I also learned a lot, as I always do, giving the talk live for the first time. I plan on revising it, and hopefully giving an improved version.

## Resources
I mentioned a lot of tools and concepts in this talk that need further exploration. Here they are:
