title: Minimal Packing for Maximum Travel
---
I've basically travelled non stop for the last two weeks, home only for last weekend. Back to back travel of fairly similar lengths makes it easy to compare, experiment, and plan a bit better.

## Planning

On some level everyone has the same process for packing:

- How long are you going to be gone?
- What events do you think you'll be going to?
- What do you think you need for each of those events?

For my last two trips those amounted to:

- Length: A week in both cases.
- Events:
    - Most of what I did in both events was attend a conference as a representative of GitHub
    - General work time
    - Socializing with other Hubbers
    - Usual day to day stuff
    - It was also safe to assume at least one high end dinner
- Needs:
    - Conference Hubbering: GitHub t-shirts (a benefit working for a company that's based on being low key and productive)

### May 13-16: [FOSE Conference](http://www.fose.com/Events/Government-Technology/Home.aspx)
This was a 4 day trip to Washington DC to man GitHub's booth at the FOSE Government IT conference. Most of our time was spent manning the booth, meaning GitHub tshirts (we wear them almost always). We also had [one nice "team dinner" out](http://graffiatodc.com/) and general chilling.

### May 19-25: [BreizhCamp](http://www.breizhcamp.org/)
This was  a bit more extenisive, as it was a longer trip, involved 2 cities (Rennes & Paris France) and a few more events. Hanging out at the conference was the same as booth duty, GitHub tshirts and jeans. My "buddy" coworker and I also went out for a very nice (Michelin <i class="fa fa-star"></i><i class="fa fa-star"></i>) lunch, so I had to have something appropriate for that. General hanging out needs  also apply.

## Execution

### My Bag for BreizhCamp

- 6 Tshirts (2 blank grey, 4 GitHub tshirts) (2 Unused + 4)
- 2 collard Shirts
- 1 pair of Jeans
- 4 socks (1 unused + 2)
- 2 pairs of shoes (One pair of loafers, one pair of Tom's)
- 6 pairs of unmentionables

### Luggage
For both of these two weeks I packed a single bag; a 2010 North Face Surge backpack. This was my primary travel bag.

In both cases I also included a small, fraying, softsided tweed shoulder bag from the Gap to use walking around. This is great because I can roll it up and either lash it to my backpack or put it in with my clothes.

### Toiletries
Honestly this is a tough one. In 95% of hotels a certain set of things (like soap and shampoo) are always included, yet things like toothbrushes never are. Not sure where the line is.

### Hardware
Not clothing related but certainly relevant to packing for technical folks.

## Changes
- Always carry MacBook Air vs Macbook Pro.
- Stop carrying my iPad
    - I tend to bring my iPad on trips, mostly so I have something light to carry when dragging my 15" MacBook Pro seems like too much. But with
- Get a GoRuck GR1.

Even enough for a  restaurant.
