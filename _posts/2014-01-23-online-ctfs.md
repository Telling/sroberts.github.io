title: Online CTFs
---
I've been lucky neough to play in a number of computer attack & defend (sometimes only one or the other) [Capture The Flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security). They've been some of the best learning experiences I've ever had and a ton of fun. It really compresses all of cyber security, minus that boring policy stuff, into a smaller timeframe.

Even with all the benefits there is one tough part: you can't always spend a weekend in a friends basement with a pallet of Redbull or on the floor at DefCon CTF. Until CTF season rolls around this spring there are two new all online CTFs from big name companies:

* Square/Matasano: [MicroCorruption](https://microcorruption.com)
* Stripe: [Stripe-CTF](https://stripe-ctf.com/account)

I took a quick look at MicroCorruption over lunch and it's unique take focused on embedded software security is facinating. They've put together a great interface, putting hardware debugging & exploitation in a web browser. But I'm really excited to get into Stripe-CTF. I've already heard it's a great way to dig into a number of languages and software security topics.

So if you're looking for a good learning exercise, specifically around security, these will likely be a great way to learn something new and gear up for the big kid CTFs this summer.
