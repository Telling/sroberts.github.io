So I talk a lot about Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) in terms of specific niches or really esoteric issues, but what does someone who's brand new to the field really need to know to get started? DFIR, at least as I view it, is a really broad field, so here are some of the basic of the things you should know as an introduction to DFIR and where to learn more.

## What is DFIR?

Digital Forensics & Incident Response is a multidiciplinary profession that focuses on identifying, investigating, and remediating computer network exploitation.
