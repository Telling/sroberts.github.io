title: Crisis Communications for IR
---

In September I wrote about [Crisis Communications in Incident Response](http://sroberts.github.io/2014/09/22/crisis-comms-for-ir/) and after some great feedback I expanded it and built a presentation. I gave this presentation in June at [FIRST](http://www.first.org/conference/2015) and today (July 8th) at [SANS DFIR Summit](https://www.sans.org/event/digital-forensics-summit-2015). Both were great events and I highly recommend them.  

## My Slides

_I'm going to actually do a post soon (I hope) on building security presentations. In case you're curious I built this deck using [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/). [Here's the Gist of my presentation markdown (with speaker notes)](https://gist3.github.com/9f6760f24231f3678d95.git)._

## My Notes & Links

This includes the important links and other references in the presentation, including the quotes. See above for speaker notes.

I may have more opportunities to give this in the future, but I hope the blogpost, deck, and notes will help others improving their crisis communications plans.
