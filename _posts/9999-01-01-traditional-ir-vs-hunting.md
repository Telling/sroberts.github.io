title: Incident Response is Dead... Long Live Incident Response
---

Talk to anyone in the "DFIR Illumanati" and one of the topics that always comes up is "hunting". Much like threat intelligence & string theory people talk a lot about this, but nearly no one knows what it actually means.

## Proactive vs. Reactive

At it's core _Hunting_ is about taking a proactive vs a reactive approach to incident. In _Reactive_ organizations an incident starts when notification comes in; whether that's an IDS or AV alert, or worse a phone call from the FBI or getting [Krebs](http://krebsonsecurity.com/)-ed. At that point an IR begins, reacting to the incoming event.

In _Hunting organizations_ the IR team actively goes looking for incidents based on known patterns of activity, intelligence, even just hunches. The major approaches are target centric (If we know Project Unicorn is valuable and possibly targeted, start hunting around people involved with Project Unicorn) or actor centric  (we know Actor Troll likes attacking organizations like ours, so identify as much information about Actor Troll and used that to proactively look across the organization)

## Hunting Mindset

What does it take to build a hunting team? First of all it takes a complete change in mindset and proceedures.

### A Target Centric Mindset
### An Actor Centric Mindset
### Wide Ranging Telemetry
### The ability to look for indicators at scale

### Management Buy In

Ok... this part gets weird. You would think that your leadership would be super excited to know about all these newly discovered incidents and having the chance to remediate them. Turns out they often aren't, especially if you work in a regulated industry (like finance, medicine, or the DIB). In many cases leadership would rather [_keep their head in the sand_](http://www.weedist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Head-In-Sand.jpg) than deal with the reality (like regulators), and the hunt team becomes a victim of it's own success. I know of one organization where a mature hunting team was told to [watch movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190536/) and [play video games](http://www.hedgewars.org/) rather than track down more malicious activity. #truestory
