title: How I Atom
---

During the time I've been at GitHub one of the coolest projects to come out has been [Atom](https://atom.io/), GitHub's own text editor. I've been using it since the day it got released internally at GitHub and while I've had my good days and bad with it I can say without a doubt one of my 3 top used applications and an essential part of my work flow. That said getting started with Atom isn't straight forward.

What makes Atom shine, even next to a great editor like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (My old favorite) or a classic like VIM, is it's extensibility. Getting started with such highly extensible tool is tough, so here's a few ideas based on how I use Atom that might get you started.

## How I Use Atom

| % | Language | Reason |
| - | -------- | ------ |
| 45% | Markdown | Markdown iss the standard document format for most things at GitHub and given how comfortable it is I've shifted most of my personal documents and writing (including this blog) to Markdown so it's where I spend about half my time. |
| 35% | Python | GitHub is a Ruby shop it's true, but Python is the language of security (yes yes, I know about Metasploit). I typically write smaller Python utilities, but occasionally get into bigger Django projects like GRR |
| 10% | CoffeeScript | Not a terribly common language for a security engineer CoffeeScript is the language of Hubot. DevOps-ing security tools is so awesome I've already talked about it... multiple times.
| 5% | _Webstack_ HTML/CSS/JS | Mostly for this blog. |
| 5% | Randomness | Mostly Go these days. I end up playing with lots of different things. |

## [Packages](https://atom.io/packages)

The easy place to start with Atom is plugins. Here are my favorites:

### [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/zen)

You can pay a fair bit of money to buy a _minialist_ text editor. Or you can just use Zen. This plugin (by GitHub's CEO @defunkt no less) turns Atom into a 100% focused text only editor experience.

### [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

This plugin takes structured filetypes and noramlizes them, presenting them in a cleaner, more humanly greppable way. I most commmonly use it to take JSON from APIs, which is often presented as one line, and adding the new lines and indenting that makes it human readable.

### [dash](https://atom.io/packages/dash) & [dash-on-cursor](https://atom.io/packages/dash-on-cursor)

I think of Atom as more than a text editor and less than an IDE, in the best ways possible. There are two big IDE features that I've added to my Atom setup and the first one is getting documentation from Dash using dash & dash-on-cursor. Just hitting Ctrl+h instantly does a context specific search for the term you're on and pulls it up in Dash. Whats even better is this is offline documentation, so even in low/no bandwidth situations you can keep working.

You don't have Dash? If you're a developer using a Mac then you're doing it wrong, I can't recommend it enough.

### [date](https://atom.io/packages/date)

Such a small utility, date lets you print a variety of date and timestaps. Highly useful if you're writing up documentation on something like an incident. Which I do.... a lot.

### [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)

This should probably go under Themes more than under Plugins, but it's a plugin so here it will stay. This plugin gives a prettier, more expanisive icon set for the sidebar and tabs of Atom. These visual identifiers are often handy given modern projects base on web frameworks have so many different types of files involved.

### [go-plus](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus)

If you're using Go you'll take a look at this plugin, marvel in the awesome, and instantly install it. If you aren't it's basically useless, and pops a lot of annoying errors.  

### [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter), [linter-write-good](https://atom.io/packages/linter-write-good), [linter-pylint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-pylint), & [jsonlint](https://atom.io/packages/jsonlint)

The other major IDE like function I get out of Atom is based on the linter plugin. Linters, which let you know when you're not complying with the language specification, are a great example of one of the IDE like benefits you can have in Atom. Think of it like spell check for programming languages, linters let you know when youre doing things inforrectly.

The linter package is the start, then you can hunt down the linters most relevent to your own development.

### [merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts)

Ahhh the bane of every Git users existance, the merge conflict. The merge-conflicts plugin helps make these easier to deal with, giving you visual queues and instantly snapping to each conflict.

![Bad Hotlinked Merge Conflict Gif](https://i.github-camo.com/44ff44f156f274b8799022e44bcacb804fadc08a/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f736d61736877696c736f6e2f6d657267652d636f6e666c696374732f6d61737465722f646f63732f636f6e666c6963742d7265736f6c7574696f6e2e676966)

I don't hit conflicts that often, but when I do this plug makes it easy to sort through them quickly.

### [regex-railroad-diagram](https://atom.io/packages/regex-railroad-diagram)

![Get on the Train! ](https://i.github-camo.com/8466434b7e61870e51dbee19b0bc1173846e7a89/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6b6c6f72656e7a2f61746f6d2d72656765782d7261696c726f61642d6469616772616d732f333535323636373232386331393265383161306432653538343365383234633036346238653462392f72656765782d7261696c726f61642d6469616772616d732e706e67)

I've used lots of tools to help me understand regexs. They're complicated things and it's often easy for one character to change the meaning or function of a regex. The regex-railroad-diagram gives you a visual aid for understanding any regex. I rely on it heavily.

### [sort-lines](https://atom.io/packages/sort-lines)

Super simple, but super useful. While you wouldn't want to sort code this comes in useful quite often when writing prose.

## [Themes](https://atom.io/themes)

I won't go too nuts talking about themes. It's 100% personal preference. Themese come in two portions, UI & syntax. I find the best option is to play with them.

- outlander-syntax
- outlander-ui
- seti-syntax
- seti-ui
- unity-ui

Personally I swap mine in and out fairly regularly. Right now I'm simply using the built in Atom Light option for both.

### Other Recommended Packages:

- vim-mode: Coming from everyone's favorite terminal editor and miss your key commands, you can hold on to them!
- minimap: Hold over from Sublime Text? minimap will make you feel at home.

## Tricks
- Command-Shift-p: Everything. So much of Atom is hidden behind the text menu. You'll miss it otherwise.
- Take a look at each package & theme for their own settings. These tweaks can often make a big difference. For instance I always check the "Force Show" option on the file-icons plugin.

## How I Don't Use Atom

__Logs.__ It's that simple. Atom doesn't handle fles 2mb or bigger, so it's a _no go_ for log analysis. Early on in my switch to Atom log analysis was the main situation I'd go back to Sublime Text, but at this point I do almost everything on the commandline. Sed/Awk/Grep and ./jq are amazing tools and at this point I think I'm faster working through logs on the commandline than I ever was in a text editor.
