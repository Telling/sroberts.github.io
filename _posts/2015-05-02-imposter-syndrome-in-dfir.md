title: Imposter Syndrome in DFIR

> Impostor syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true. It is experienced internally as chronic self-doubt, and feelings of intellectual fraudulence.

There isn't really an easy way to jump into a post like like this, and in many ways there doesn't need to be. Imposter Syndrome is something a lot of people don't know a lot about (I'd never heard the idea until I started working at GitHub) but it's something immediately familiar once it's explained. 

What's interesting to me is an Imposter Syndrome is a lot like a childs boogie man; open the closet, turn on the lights, take a look around, and you see that nothing is there and for a moment you feel better. Exposing it, taking a good hard look, and acknowledging that everyone feels a similar way makes a big difference. But it doesnt't go away entirely... so you have to expose it again. 

The other complication is that while everyone experiences imposter syndrome it manifests itself in unique and individualized ways for everyone. So with that in mind, and knowing that openness and honest is one of these keys (both to help myself and others), this is my take on the imposter syndrome I have experienced as a Digital Forensics & Incident Response professional:

## The "Blinky Lights" Inferiority
> "What if they make a box that does what I do?"

## The Offensive Inferiority
> "Red team bros just constantly say how easy it is to get around what I spent months building."

## The "Jack of All Trades" Inferiority
> "I'm a worse RE than our RE and a worse 4n6 than our 4n6icator and a worse dev then our developer and a worse ops than our ops."

## The "80/20" Inferiority
> "About 95% of the time I just sit around being a mediocre software developer or systems engineer."

## The "Human Being" Inferiority


## In The End

No one ever gets away from Imposter Syndrome entirely. It's a human condition, but we can seek to understand it, to control it, and not let it control us. I think a willingess to confront this, withourselves and our teams, can make everyone stronger.
