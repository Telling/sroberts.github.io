title: Learning Git & GitHub
---

I suppose it makes sense that when you work for a company everyone assumes you know everything about using its products. When I worked at [Symantecs Managed Security Services](http://www.symantec.com/managed-security-services) people asked me all the time how to use the antivirus. It's a normal assumption, even if it's off base.

So working at [GitHub](http://www.github.com) I get asked [git](http://git-scm.com/) & GitHub questions all the time. #REALTALK: The fact is I'm not a great git user. I don't rebase. I'm terrible about using bisect. There are all kinds of features I know exist but hardly ever use. That said I know about 90% of what I need to use git effectively, and I've gotten pretty good at GitHub (the product) itself. So here's where I learned and what I think will help you get the most out of git and GitHub.

## Learning Git
Just in case you don't know what Git is:
>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
>
>Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

To learn git I recommend starting out with [Try Git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). This is a quick, 15 min tutorial that introduces the core concepts of git that you'll need and is enough to get started. It's pretty much the ideal place to start, and you don't even need to install anything.
