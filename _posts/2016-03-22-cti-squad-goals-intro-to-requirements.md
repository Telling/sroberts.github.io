title: CTI SquadGoals - Setting Requirements
---

I'll be honest... I didn't think to write this post until I'd been getting reviews about the next post. I started writing about planning intelligence collection and how organizations should approach it. A kind friend who's good enough to edit much of what I write asked where my requirements post was. He was right, I was putting the cart before the horse, the exact kind of thing I pontificate on not doing.

Here we are. Requirements. The first part of the intelligence cycle and the most neglected. According to the [appendix of Joint Publication 2-0: Joint Intelligence](http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp2_0.pdf)

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x pull-left"></i>__intelligence requirement.__ 1. Any subject, general or specific, upon which there is a need
for the collection of information, or the production of intelligence. 2. A requirement for
intelligence to fill a gap in the commandâ€™s knowledge or understanding of the
operational environment or threat forces.

Requirements set the entire priority of your intelligence cycle, what sources you collect from, what types of processing you need to do, and what methods of dissemination will meet the need.

## Business Plan Requirements

People who steal money attack banks. People who steal IP attack research companies.

## Technology Requirements

Car thieves attack if you have a car.

## Vertical Requirements

Talking to other orgs like you could enlighten requirements you might have.

## Geographic Requirements

Where you do business defines your threats.

## One Offs

Hard to know...
