title: Security Development in Go
---

I've primarily been a Python coder (I hesitate to say developer, and don't want to touch "engineer" with a 10 foot pole) for most of my career. Python is a great language, easy to pick up, well supported (both libraries and operating systems), and is generally capable of most tasks.

That said for the past couple years I've wanted to move into a more structured, systems style language, and even made it [one of my professional goals for the year](http://sroberts.github.io/2015/01/06/2015-professional-goals/). C & C++ are the defaults in that category, but a bit intimdating and seem challenging to get a project started in. I looked into Rust, and while interesting it seemed a bit more of a departure from my beloved Python.

I ended up choosing Google's [Go](http://golang.org/), wanting a systems language with general applicablity (like a more performant Python). This past weekend was my first push and so far I'm a big fan and after getting a bit more familiar I think Go is a great language for a variety of security development tasks.
