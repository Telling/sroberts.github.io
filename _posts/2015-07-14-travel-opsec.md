I spent the middle of June attending the FIRST 2015 conference in Berlin. This was a great conference, good talks (including yours truely) and an even better hallway track. I'd never been to Berlin, or Germany in general, and I enjoyed seeing this amazing city a little bit as well.

Travelling to a new country as a security minded person is always a bit jarring. Even a country as friendly as Germany bares consideration when it comes to IT resources like laptops, tablets, phones, etc. Being that FIRST has people coming from all over the place, including people from countries at odds (US, China, Iran, Germany, etc). As a result those IT security concerns are even a little more hightend. As a result we ended up having a few different academic conversations about operational security while traveling internationally, and is a worthwhile consideration.

## The Challenges

Traveling internationally has some unique challenges compared to using IT resources at home.

### Power
Running around a new country one of the first things you might notice is powering your devices can be tricky. Plugs are different, voltages are different, and you may be limited by adapters.

### Network

### Movement

## The Threat

The first question for security should always be "What is the threat?". If you're basing your security stance in any regard on anything but practical threats. While we exhagerate threats often in this case their seems to be plenty of concerns.

### Seizure at Checkpoints

### _Evil Maid_ Style Attacks

### _Dark Hotel_ Style Attacks

### Buckshot Yankee & Stuxtnet Style Attacks + Accidental Syncing

Power seems only partially related to security, but USB based charging is common for many tablets and phones (even the new Apple MacBook & Chromebook Pixel) . It's also one of the more insidious ways to compromise offline devices.

Plugging a device into a USB charging dock in an airport or into a new friends laptop is an easy way to get an extra 10% power, but risks picking up malware or syncing your mobile device and handing over all the data on it. It's up to you to decide which one is bad and which one is worse.

### Theft & Loss

### Finally... The Honeypot

I'm not going into this, but I :heart: me some Archer and we can always use a good gif.

## The Plan: Rules for International Travel OpSec

### International Travel Rule #1: LEAVE IT AT :house:

I cannot emphasize this enough. If you don't have it with you it cannot be compromised.

### International Travel Rule #2: Prep It Before You Leave

#### Loners & Alternatives

Borrower, iPad, Chromebook.

#### Patch Everything
- Operating System
- Applications (Especially those you use every day and common vector apps like Adobe Acrobat & Reader, Microsoft Office, Flash, your broswer (or just switch to Chrome))
- Secondary tools (Like Browser plugins)

#### Setup a VPN

#### Prepare 2FA

#### Privacy Screen Cover

#### USB "Condom"

I feel a bit uncouth using that term, but it's the most common term. Sorry if you read this mom.

Charging USB devices wherever you happen to be, including off of USB charging stations or someone elses laptop is convenient, but runs the risk of exposing you to USB transmited malware. A USB condom protects you by breaking the data transfer connections of USB while leaving the power connections intact. That means you can charge your device without inadvertently syncing data or worse.

I have one from [Satori's Company](http://www.example.com) that's great.

### International Travel Rule #3: Be Aware of your Surroundings

### International Travel Rule #4: Keep Things Turned Off & Logged Out

Wifi, Bluetooth, etc. It's inconvinet but it works wonders, otherwise you may find yourself randomly connecting to .
