title: My Favoirte Open Source Security Tools
---
So working at [GitHub](http://github.com) it's no surprise I believe in and use a lot of open source software. I think especially for security this makes sense, for a number of reasons:
* We need tools we can trust, so transparancy is key
* We need tools we can modify, since we often need things that don't exist
* We need tools that are cross platform

And the list goes on. I try to support these projects, with code, with feedback, with use, and sometimes, with praise. So here are a few of my favorite open source security tools:

## [Google's Rapid Response](https://code.google.com/p/grr/)
Ok, #realtalk: This is an open source version of [Mandiant](http://www.mandiant.com)/[FireEye](http://www.fireeye.com)'s MIR incident response platform. The idea is systems have an agent that reports to a server. The server can then set up jobs to look across an individual system, a group, or an entire population for a specific indicator of compromise, individual file, or many other forensic artifacts. 

Given the expense of MIR or similar systems like Encase Enterprise it's truely astonishing the amount of effort the Google team working on GRR has put in, and it's a huge benefit to the community that they've released it. You can find more information on their [user mailing](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grr-users) list and [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/grr/) site. As a side note I made a [fork on GitHub](https://github.com/grr-hackers/grr) to encourage even more open source collaboration. I'm really intersted in talking to folks who want to work on this.
