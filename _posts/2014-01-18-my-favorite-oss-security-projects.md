title: My Favoirte Open Source Security Tools
---
So working at [GitHub](http://github.com) it's no surprise I believe in and use a lot of open source software. I think especially for security this makes sense, for a number of reasons:
* We need tools we can trust, so transparancy is key
* We need tools we can modify, since we often need things that don't exist
* We need tools that are cross platform

And the list goes on. I try to support these projects, with code, with feedback, with use, and sometimes, with praise. So here are a few of my favorite open source security tools
1. [Google's Rapid Response](https://code.google.com/p/grr/) - Live Host Forensics - [Also on GitHub](https://github.com/grr-hackers/grr)
