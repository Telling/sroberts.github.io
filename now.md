Trying something new I'm borrowing from the [nownownow](http://nownownow.com/) movement and adding my own _Now_ page. Here goes:

## Where?

Columbus, Ohio

## Projects

- Intelligence Driven Incident Response
- [sroberts/cacador](https://github.com/sroberts/cacador): An IOC extraction tool for arbitrary blocks of text.

## Upcoming Talks

- SANS Leadership Summit: Crisis Communication for Incident Response
- [ArchC0n](http://www.archc0n.org/) Panel: Chasing Shiny Objects: InfoSec budget decisions in a hype driven world
